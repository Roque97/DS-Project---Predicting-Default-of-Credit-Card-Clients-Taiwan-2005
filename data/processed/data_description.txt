Here is a description of the datasets produced by your `preprocess_data` function:

## Datasets Produced by `preprocess_data`

The function generates several datasets at different stages of preprocessing:

### 1. **original**
- **Description:**  
  The raw dataset after basic cleaning and type conversion.
- **Contents:**  
  - Numerical features converted to numeric types.
  - Categorical features mapped to meaningful labels and converted to categorical types.
  - Rows with missing values dropped.
  - Original columns retained, except for rows removed due to missing data.

### 2. **transformed**
- **Description:**  
  The dataset after feature engineering.
- **Contents:**  
  - New binary features for payment history (e.g., `PAY_0_no_consumption`, `PAY_0_paid_duly`, etc.).
  - Delay features for each payment column.
  - Original `PAY_X` columns removed.
  - Target column (`default payment next month`) converted to integer.

### 3. **encoded**
- **Description:**  
  The fully processed dataset, ready for modeling.
- **Contents:**  
  - One-hot encoded categorical features (except the target).
  - All engineered features and numerical columns.
  - Target column retained as integer.
  - ID column retained.

### 4. **X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test** (if `split_data=True`)
- **Description:**  
  Train/test splits for supervised learning.
- **Contents:**  
  - `X_train`: Features for training.
  - `X_test`: Features for testing.
  - `y_train`: Target values for training.
  - `y_test`: Target values for testing.
  - Stratified split to preserve class distribution.

### 5. **Saved CSV Files** (if `save=True`)
- **Description:**  
  All above datasets are saved as CSV files in processed.
- **Files:**  
  - `{save_prefix}_original.csv`
  - `{save_prefix}_transformed.csv`
  - `{save_prefix}_encoded.csv`
  - `{save_prefix}_X_train.csv`
  - `{save_prefix}_X_test.csv`
  - `{save_prefix}_y_train.csv`
  - `{save_prefix}_y_test.csv`

**Summary:**  
You get cleaned, feature-engineered, and encoded datasets, plus train/test splits for modeling, all optionally saved as CSV files for reproducibility and further analysis.
